	<h3>Invalid State</h3>

	<span wicket:id="error"/>
	
	This content package is in an invalid state. It may not have been properly closed, or the
	underlying data may have been corrupted. Please select "Abandon All". The page should refresh.
	At that point, select "Start". If the content package still does not play correctly, 
	please get in touch with the instructor. It may be necessary to re-validate the content package
	to solve this problem.
